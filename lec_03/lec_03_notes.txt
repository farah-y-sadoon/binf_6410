# mkdir - make a directory
mkdir binf_class

# -p to make a parent directory
mkdir binf_class/UNIX_part/Start #if you try to make a directory with a name that already exists it won't let you create it

# sudo - elevates the permissions of the user to execute commands that normally would not be accessible - BE CAREFUL DOING THIS, start fresh terminal after you are done using sudo
# e.g., making a directory in the root folder
sudo mkdir /Hello

# rmdir - remove directory
# you can delete the whole directory tree by starting at the lowest level then moving up
rmdir binf_class/UNIX_part/Start
rmdir binf_class/UNIX_part
rmdir binf_class

# touch - create a file
touch binf_class/newfile
touch binf_class/another_one

# rm - remove file
rm binf_class/newfile
ls binf_class # you will see only another_one file exists

# use option "-i" to be safe when deleting files or directories - it prompts you to ensure you are deleting the correct item
rm -i binf_class/another_one #it will prompt you to say y or n to confirm your action

# use option "-r" to recursively delete a directory, including everything within the directory and itself
rm -r binf_class

# mv - move files and rename them

mkdir binf_class
cd ~/binf_class
touch rocks.txt
touch stones.txt
mkdir quarry
mkdir stone_pile
ls
mv rocks.txt quarry
mv stones.txt stone_pile/
